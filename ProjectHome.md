<b>This project is no longer under active development</b> (as of Jan 2011)<br>
<br>
In recent years a lot of the large open source JavaScript libraries have come of age -- I can no longer justify the time it takes to develop and maintain a modern JavaScript library of comparable quality.<br>
<br>
It was good fun while it lasted, and educational.<br>
<br>
I intend to leave this project online as long as google permits. Feel free to plunder for code and ideas, a lot of good stuff in there.<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Jelly (JavaScript) provides a set of intuitively named utility functions and classes that you can build upon. It does not try to change JavaScript, but instead provides a more powerful and consistent toolset for working in the language.<br>
<br>
Jelly is designed around some core ideas:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>One global variable</b><br />While it is preferable not to have more than one party adding script to a page, the reality is that often there will be several.<br />Contributing only one variable to the global namespace minimizes the chance of collisions.<br /></li>
<li><b>Standards-based</b><br />The API follows existing ECMAScript and DOM naming conventions and terminologies where possible. The advantage is that you can stay close to the standard, rather than using more derivative abstractions that have an uncertain lifetime.<br /></li>
<li><b>Conservative native prototype extensions</b><br />Native extensions follow the language spec so useful features can be used before all the browsers have caught up. This also avoids collision with other libraries that liberally extend native prototypes with non-standard members.<br /></li>
<li><b>Lightweight</b><br />Because Jelly makes extensive use of closures, JavaScript compressors can efficiently munge local variables, and yield optimally low file sizes.<br /></li>
<li><b>Easily configured</b><br />Jelly is designed to be easily configured and compiled via command line tools.<br /></li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>
Read the QuickStart guide, for a short introduction on how the library works.<br>
<br>
<h3>Browser support</h3>
Jelly has been tested to work in Internet Explorer 6/7/8, Firefox 3+, Opera 9+, Safari 3+ and Google Chrome<br>
<br>
<h3>Compatibility with other code</h3>
Unobtrusiveness is a core goal of the Jelly library. There are no known namespace or functionality clashes with the main frameworks; jQuery, Mootools, YUI, Prototype js, ASP.NET Ajax etc.<br>
<br>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
A growing number of plugins are now in the trunk, from date-pickers to drag and drop. Browse the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/jelly-javascript/source'>source</a> for latest updates.<br>
<br>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
There is a small amount of documentation currently written inline; however, I plan to build on this over time.<br>
