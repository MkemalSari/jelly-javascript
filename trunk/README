Build Info
==========

If you want to configure your own builds you'll need to:

 1  Install a PHP( v5 or greater ) interpreter on your machine, and add it to your path
 2  Install Java runtime -- if you haven't got it already
 3  Get the latest version of the YUI Compressor, and place the excecutable somewhere in your dev directory
 4  Adjust path settings in compiler.php to your setup
 5  Modify your ini file to suit

Typically it is easier to wrap your build commands in batch files, 
so you can easily sync up your builds e.g. 

  php -f "C:\path\to\jelly\compiler.php"
  
You can use alternative ini files by passing in an extra argument -- 
useful for project specific configurations:

  php -f "C:\path\to\jelly\compiler.php" "C:\path\to\project\alt.ini"
